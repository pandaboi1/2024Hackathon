            <h3>What Is Budgeting?</h3>
            <p>
                Budgeting is like making a plan for your money. Imagine you have a little jar of candy, 
                and you want to make sure it lasts for a whole week. You decide how many pieces you can eat 
                each day, and maybe even save a few for later. 
                <br>
                In the same way, when people budget, they decide how much money to spend on things like food, 
                toys, or saving for something special, so they don’t run out too fast! It helps them make sure 
                they have enough for what they need and want.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Is Budgeting Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Budgeting is important because it helps you make sure you don't run out of money, just like if 
                you want your candy to last. If you eat all your candy on the first day, you won’t have any left 
                for the rest of the week!
                <br>
                By planning how much money to use, you can make sure you have enough for important things, 
                like food and toys, and still have some to save for later. It helps people stay happy and not 
                worry about running out!

            <h3>Different Items To Include In A Budget</h3>
            <p>
                When making a budget, you can include different things, just like when you plan what to do 
                with your toys or candy! Here are some items you might include:
            <br>
                <li>1. Food – Money for meals, snacks, and groceries.</li>
                <li>2. Fun stuff – Like toys, games, or going out with friends.</li>
                <li>3. Savings – Money to keep for something special later, like a big toy or trip.</li>
                <li>4. Bills – Things you have to pay for, like the house, electricity, or water.</li>
                <li>5. Clothes – Money for new clothes or shoes.</li>
                <li>6. Transportation – Like bus fare, gas for the car, or bike repairs.</li>
            <br>
                This helps make sure you have enough for everything you need and still get some fun things!

            <h3>What Is Credit?</h3>
            <p>
                Credit is like borrowing something, but with a promise to give it back later. 
                Imagine if your friend gives you a toy to play with, and you promise to return it next week. 
                That’s kind of how credit works, but with money!
                <br>
                When you use credit, you can buy something now, even if you don’t have all the money, 
                but you have to pay it back later. If you’re good at paying it back, people will trust you more, 
                just like if you always return your friend's toy on time!
            </p>

            <h3>Is Credit Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, credit is important! It helps people get things they need when they don’t have all the 
                money right away, like a house, a car, or even an education. It's like when you borrow a toy 
                from a friend—you can enjoy it now and return it later.
                <br>
                If you're good at paying back what you borrow (just like returning the toy), people trust you 
                more. This trust helps you borrow bigger things in the future. But if you don’t return the toy 
                or the money on time, it can make it harder to borrow again. So, good credit helps with future 
                plans!
            </p>

            <h3>Important Habits To Keep!</h3>
            <p>
                Building good habits with credit is essential for managing your finances and maintaining a 
                healthy credit score. Here are some important habits:
                <br>
               <li> <b> 1. Pay on time, every time </b> 
                - Your payment history makes up a significant part of your credit score, so always pay at least the 
                minimum amount due by the due date. Late payments can hurt your score and result in fees</li>
                <br>
               <li> <b> 2. Keep your credit utilization low </b>
                - Try to use less than 30% of your available credit. This means if you have a $1,000 credit limit, 
                avoid carrying a balance higher than $300</li>
                <br>
                <li>3. Pay off your balance in full 
                - Whenever possible, pay your credit card balance in full each month. This avoids interest charges 
                and keeps you out of debt</li>
                <br>
                <li>4. Monitor your credit regularly  
                - Check your credit reports for any mistakes or signs of fraud.</li>
            </p>
