        <h2>Zero Based Budgeting</h2>
        <p> What is Zero Based Budgeting?</p>
        <p> Zero-based budgeting starts fresh each month, with no preconceived ideas about how you'll spend your money.

        Imagine giving every dollar you have a specific job—whether it's for bills, savings, debt repayment, or even fun activities ensuring that every dollar is accounted for.
               
        By the end of the month, your total income minus your total expenses should equal zero. This doesn't mean you're spending all your money recklessly; it means you're thoughtfully planning where each dollar goes.
                
        The key to this method is re-evaluating your financial situation at the beginning of each month and creating a new budget based on that. 
                
        This approach forces you to be mindful of your spending habits, helping you prioritize what's truly important.
                
        Over time, this method can lead to better control over your finances, as you'll constantly be adjusting your budget to reflect your current needs and goals, ensuring that no money is left unassigned.
                
        It's about being proactive rather than reactive with your finances, giving you a clearer picture of where your money is going and how it's working for you.

        <h2>50-30-20 Budgeting</h2>
        <p>What is 50-30-20 budgeting?</p>
        <p>The 50-30-20 budgeting method is a simple way to manage your after-tax income. 
        It splits your money into three parts: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings. 
        
        Needs are things like housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, and minimum debt payments—stuff you can't live without. 
        
        Wants are for fun things like dining out, entertainment, and hobbies. 
        
        Savings are for building an emergency fund, retirement, and paying off debt.
                
        This method is popular because it's easy to follow and flexible. 
        It helps you track your spending and make changes based on your financial situation. 
        The 50-30-20 method ensures you cover your essential needs, enjoy life, and save for the future. 
        By regularly reviewing and adjusting your budget, you can stay on top of your finances, set goals, and achieve financial stability.

    <div id="envelopeSystem">
        <h2>Envelope Budgeting</h2>
        <p>What is Envelope Budgeting?</p>
        <p>Envelope budgeting is a simple budgeting method where you allocate a specific amount of cash for different spending categories and place that cash in labeled envelopes.
                
        Each envelope represents a category, such as groceries, entertainment, or transportation. 
            
        When the cash in an envelope is gone, you can't spend any more in that category for the month.
            
        This approach helps people manage their finances by visualizing their spending limits and encourages disciplined spending. 
            
        Although traditionally done with cash, it can also be adapted for digital use with budgeting apps that mimic the envelope system.

    <div id="payYourselfFirst">
        <h2>Pay Yourself Budgeting</h2>
        <p>What is Pay Yourself Budgeting?</p>
        <p>"Pay yourself first" budgeting means saving or investing money before spending on anything else. 
            As soon as you get paid, you put a set amount into savings or investments. 
            This way, you make sure you're building wealth for emergencies, retirement, or other goals.
            To make it work, set specific savings goals and automate the transfers right after you get your paycheck.
            Once you've saved, you can budget the rest for bills and fun stuff. 
            This method helps you build a habit of saving first, so you don't spend all your money before thinking about your future.

        <h2>Priority Based Budgeting</h2>
        <p>What is Priority Based Budgeting?</p>
        <p>Priority-based budgeting means giving your money to the most important things first. 
            Instead of spreading money evenly, you focus on essential stuff like living costs, debt, savings, and key investments. 
            You start by figuring out your top goals and sorting your expenses by importance. 
            This method helps you use limited money wisely by putting it where it matters most.
            You make a list of what’s most important, and spend money on those things first. 
            As your situation changes, you can adjust your priorities and spending. 
            This way, you’re always funding the most important goals and making smart choices with your money. 
            It helps you plan better and keep a steady financial future.
